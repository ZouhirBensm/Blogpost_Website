# Blogpost_Website

This website was written with HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I used Node.js and Express.js in the backend. For the databases I used Mongo DB which is a noSQL database. This software has 2 main databases. One is to store users and the other is to strore Blogposts. Mongoose and Nodemon were useful for this project. I also used EJS templating engine for more efficiency.
