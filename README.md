# Blogpost_Website

This website was written with HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I used Node.js and Express.js in the backend. For the databases I used Mongo DB which is a noSQL database. This software has 2 main databases. One is to store users and the other is to store Blogposts. Mongoose (to connect to mongoSB database) and Nodemon (for continuous development) were useful for this project. I also used EJS templating engine for more efficiency. The pages are dynamically generated from the server. Node.JS is fast and efficient because of it's runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
